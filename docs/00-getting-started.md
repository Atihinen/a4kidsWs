## What is Arduino

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction) is open source harware meant for electronics beginners. It can read inputs e.g. button presses and use outputs e.g. set LED on or turn motor to some direction.

You can also use USB serial interface to communicate with your computer to Arduino and vice versa.

## What is Scratch

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about) allows people to to creative stories and games and helps young ones to learn creative thinking.

[S4A](http://s4a.cat/) is a Scratch modification derivied to help out young ones to start doing software for embedded environments like Arduino, hence the name Scratch for Arduino.

## S4A

S4A provides full UI and graphical programming interface to create and modify your code.

### Open S4A

After installation you should see on desktop or Start Menu the S4A icon
